# Treasure Hunt Intelligent Agent
This repository is for the assignment '8-2 Journal: Portfolio Item' in the course CS370. This is a way to reflect on and showcase the work completed in this course.

## Project Summary
For this project, I designed an AI agent capable of playing and beating the 'treasure hunt' game. The AI agent can navigate the game world, which includes various pathways and obstacles, with the objective of finding the treasure before the human player. To achieve this, I utilized a Q-learning algorithm to train the AI to play the game efficiently. The initial code provided for this project included the 'GameExperience.py' and 'TreasureMaze.py' files. Additionally, I received instructions in a Jupyter Notebook file to guide me through the expectations for the final project of this course. See the 'Waren_Jeffery_ProjectTwoMilestone.ipynb' file for the implementation of the deep Q-learning algorithm.
